### Overview of the analysis: The purpose of this analysis is to understand the relationships between all of the users and subscribers of CitiBikes. The data that it initially presented was raw and difficult to interpret. While using data visualization the purpose of the task can be solved in a more diverse and manageable manner.
### Result: the highest usage of the bikes during the day seems to be related to the beginning and end of a workday. While weekends have a wider dispersion in the afternoon. Males are the more frequent users of Citi bikes. The majority of the riders' trip duration seems to be around 10-20.

### Summary: Based on the results there are a lot of potentials for the Citi bikes to generate more revenue. One is for them to offer a lower price for 30 min traffic hours and possibly bundle it into a monthly user deal where the rider can choose multiple days of 30 min riding sessions. Other visualizations that would bring in my light to the topic would be a bar chart and pie chart. These two visualizations would be great for A/B testing between males and females.
